Their population dynamics are assessed using an age-, length- and sex-structured model (Stock Synthesis v3). The assessment model used was similar to that in the 2017 benchmark assessment, with four important changes: 1) adjusting coefficients of variation for the abundance index in 2020-21 to better reflect uncertainty surrounding disruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic, 2) adjustments to Japan longline fleet structure, 3) adjustments to adult abundance indices, and 4) adjustments to age selectivity.

The assessment assumes that there is one stock of bigeye in the eastern Pacific. The reference models for the 2020 benchmark assessment of bigeye were built based on three overarching hypotheses. The first deals with the cause of an apparent recruitment shift which coincides with the expansion of the floating-object fishery, and whether this shift is real, or an artefact of model misspecification. The second hypothesis examines the causes of the recruitment shift, assuming it is due to model misspecification. The third hypothesis deals with the steepness of the Beverton-Holt stock-recruitment relationship. In total, 44 reference models were retained in the benchmark assessment. These reference models on which the management advice is based were combined using relative weights determined by several criteria, including performance on model diagnostics.

The first deals with the cause of an apparent recruitment shift which coincides with the expansion of the floating-object fishery, and whether this shift is real, or an artefact of model misspecification. The second hypothesis examines the causes of the recruitment shift, assuming it is due to model misspecification.

Skipjack are difficult to assess with standard stock assessment methods, due to high and variable productivity, and uncertainties in natural mortality and growth. The 2017 assessment used a simple model to generate indicators of biomass, recruitment and exploitation rate, and compared these to historically observed values (Maunder & Deriso 2007). A new assessment completed in 2022 was updated to use an integrated statistical age-structured catch-at-length stock assessment for skipjack tuna in the eastern Pacific Ocean using Stock Synthesis.

Engagement refers to the total extent of fishing activity in a community; it can be expressed in terms of commercial activity (e.g., landings, revenues, permits, processing, etc.) or recreational activity (e.g., number of boat launches, number of charter boat and fishing guide license holders, number of charter boat trips, number of bait and tackle shops, etc.). Reliance is the per capita engagement of a community; thus, in two communities with equal engagement, the community with the smaller population would have a higher reliance on its fisheries activities.

Grid points between 43.5-48 degrees N and from the shore out to 150 km offshore are used in the analysis.,"In eastern boundary upwelling ecosystems the spatial footprint of cool upwelled water is regularly demarcated by the differential boundary of warmer oceanic water offshore from cooler coastal water, with upwelling conditions varying with latitude. Therefore, the goal of the habitat compression index (HCI) is to track the area of cool surface waters as an index of potential 'upwelling habitat' for assessing the spatio-temporal aspects of upwelling. Upwelling patterns of cold nutrient-rich water are clearly assessed by models and satellite observations and classified spatially by monitoring SST values less than and equal to a monthly resolved temperature threshold. The HCI tracks the amount of area, determined by the number of grid cells in the model with 2 m surface temperature values less than the monthly temperature threshold, therefore the time series reflects the area of cool water adjacent to the coastline and provides a measure for how compressed cool surface temperatures may be in a particular month. In this study (Schroeder et al. 2022; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1470160X22009931), we extracted modeled 2 m temperature fields over the domain of 35.5-40 degree N for each month and tracked the amount of area with temperature values less than and equal to a monthly temperature threshold, resulting in monthly time series starting January 1980. Monthly temperature thresholds for a given month is the spatial average of 2 m temperature grid cells between 35.5-40N from shore out to 75 km for the time period 1980-2010. Cool expansion periods (low compression) are defined as months with HCI values exceeding + 1 standard deviation (SD) of the full time series, limited cool habitat (high compression) where area of cool water is less than the mean (MN) of the full time series, and periods of medium compression when the area of cool water falls between the +1 SD and the MN.",oc_hci_M.csv,oc_hci_M.csv,1,,,,1,,,,n,e,1980,2024,https://oceanview.pfeg.noaa.gov/cciea-table/images/docimages/current/Monthly_cciea_OC_HCI1_5_1980_2024_1110.png,0,1

The latest (2023) stock assessment report was completed through the International Scientific Committee for Tuna and Tuna-like Species in the North Pacific Ocean (ISC). North Pacific albacore are considered to be one stock throughout the North Pacific Ocean. They are fished throughout their range by multiple countries, mostly using surface gear (troll and pole and line), as well as pelagic longlines and other gears. Their population dynamics are assessed using an age-, length- and sex-structured model (Stock Synthesis v3). The assessment model used was similar to that in the 2017 benchmark assessment, with four important changes: 1) adjusting coefficients of variation for the abundance index in 2020-21 to better reflect uncertainty surrounding disruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic, 2) adjustments to Japan longline fleet structure, 3) adjustments to adult abundance indices, and 4) adjustments to age selectivity. The full assessment is available from http://isc.fra.go.jp/reports/stock_assessments.html.

The first deals with the cause of an apparent recruitment shift which coincides with the expansion of the floating-object fishery, and whether this shift is real, or an artefact of model misspecification. The second hypothesis examines the causes of the recruitment shift, assuming it is due to model misspecification.

Skipjack tuna are assumed to comprise one contiguous stock throughout the Pacific ocean. In the eastern Pacific, they are primarily fished in tropical waters, using purse seine gear. Skipjack are difficult to assess with standard stock assessment methods, due to high and variable productivity, and uncertainties in natural mortality and growth. The 2017 assessment used a simple model to generate indicators of biomass, recruitment and exploitation rate, and compared these to historically observed values (Maunder & Deriso 2007). A new assessment completed in 2022 was updated to use an integrated statistical age-structured catch-at-length stock assessment for skipjack tuna in the eastern Pacific Ocean using Stock Synthesis.

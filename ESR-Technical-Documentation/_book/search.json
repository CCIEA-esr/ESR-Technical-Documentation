    "text": "The Oceanic Niño Index (ONI) describes the equatorial El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO). An ONI above 0.5°C indicates El Niño conditions, which often lead to lower primary production, weaker upwelling, poleward transport of equatorial waters and species, and more southerly storm tracks in the CCE. An ONI below -0.5°C means La Niña conditions, which create atmospheric pressure conditions that lead to upwelling-favorable winds that drive productivity in the CCE.\nThe Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) describes North Pacific sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies that may persist for many years. Positive PDOs are associated with warmer SST and lower productivity in the CCE, while negative PDOs indicate cooler SST and are associated with higher productivity.\nThe North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO), an index of sea surface height, indicates changes in circulation that affect source waters for the CCE. Positive NPGOs are associated with strong equatorward flow and higher salinity, nutrients, and chlorophyll-a in the CCE. Negative NPGOs are associated with decreased subarctic source water and lower CCE productivity.",

    "text": "Spatial variability in patterns of upwelling, including the distribution of upwelled water and associated development of hydrographic fronts, is important for ecosystem monitoring and assessment of marine heatwaves and ecosystem shifts that can impact coastal fishing communities. Coastal upwelling creates a band of relatively cool coastal water, which is suitable habitat for a diverse and productive portion of the CCE food web. Monitoring the area and variability of upwelling habitat provides regional measures of habitat compression—an indicator to monitor the incursion of offshore warming (e.g., from heatwaves or reduced upwelling conditions) over shelf waters, which relates to shifts in the pelagic forage species community in space and time. Santora et al. (2020) applied principles of ecosystem oceanography and integration of fisheries surveys to develop the Habitat Compression Index (HCI) to quantify how offshore warming during the 2013–2016 marine heatwave and previous warming events restricted the cool upwelling habitat to a narrower-than-normal band along the coast. This compression of habitat consequently altered prey community composition and distribution, spatial aggregation patterns of top predators, and contributed to increased rates of whale entanglements in fixed fishing gear.\nHCI is derived from the CCE configuration of the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) model with data assimilation (Neveu et al. (2016)), and is estimated in four biogeographic provinces within the CCE: 30°-35.5°N, 35.5°-40°N, 40°-43.5°N, and 43.5°-48°N. HCI is defined as the area of monthly averaged ROMS model temperatures at a depth of 2 m that fall below a temperature threshold. Each region/month has a unique temperature threshold, based on its distinct historic climatology.\nNote: perhaps we could replace highlighted text with “The Habitat Compression Index (HCI) is a model-derived measure of the area of cool habitat along the coast, which is suitable for a diverse and productive portion of the CCE food web.

DO is required for organismal respiration; low DO can compress habitat and cause stress or die-offs for sensitive species. Waters with DO levels &lt;1.4 mL/L (~ 2 mg/L, note unit change) are considered to be hypoxic; such conditions may occur on the shelf following the onset of spring upwelling, and continue into the summer and early fall months until the fall transition vertically mixes shelf waters. Upwelling-driven hypoxia occurs because upwelled water from deeper ocean sources tends to be low in DO, and microbial decomposition of organic matter in the summer and fall increases overall system respiration and oxygen consumption, particularly closer to the seafloor (Chan et al.

A key indicator of OA is aragonite saturation state, a measure of the availability of aragonite (a form of calcium carbonate). Aragonite saturation &lt;1.0 indicates relatively acidified, corrosive conditions that are stressful for many CCE species, particularly shell-forming invertebrates. OA impacts on these species can propagate through marine food webs and potentially affect fisheries (Marshall et al. 2017).

    "text": "In addition to being a lipid-rich prey source, preliminary analyses suggest the megalopae index from Oregon light traps is strongly correlated with commercial landings of Dungeness crab four years later (Shanks et al., in prep). Note that commercial catches are limited to males that are roughly 4 years old, so landings can also be interpreted as the 4-year-old year class of the population. There was also a noted difference in the relationship between heatwave and non-heatwave years. Within this time series, there were three years (2015, 2016, and 2019) when marine heat waves occurred over the continental shelf off Oregon. These results suggest that the size of the Dungeness crab population is strongly influenced by the annual larval success, as indicated by the number of megalopae caught; and in years with marine heat waves, recruitment from megalopae to 4-year-old crabs is higher. While only Oregon data are shown, the light trap data is positively correlated with commercial catch in California, but is not correlated with catches in Washington. This index stems from a collaborative effort between the Oregon Institute of Marine Biology (OIMB, University of Oregon) and ODFW and warrants further attention in the future as an additional index of prey availability in this region.",

    "text": "Spatial variability in patterns of upwelling, including the distribution of upwelled water and associated development of hydrographic fronts, is important for ecosystem monitoring and assessment of marine heatwaves and ecosystem shifts that can impact coastal fishing communities. Coastal upwelling creates a band of relatively cool coastal water, which is suitable habitat for a diverse and productive portion of the CCE food web. Monitoring the area and variability of upwelling habitat provides regional measures of habitat compression—an indicator to monitor the incursion of offshore warming (e.g., from heatwaves or reduced upwelling conditions) over shelf waters, which relates to shifts in the pelagic forage species community in space and time. Santora et al. (2020) applied principles of ecosystem oceanography and integration of fisheries surveys to develop the Habitat Compression Index (HCI) to quantify how offshore warming during the 2013–2016 marine heatwave and previous warming events restricted the cool upwelling habitat to a narrower-than-normal band along the coast. This compression of habitat consequently altered prey community composition and distribution, spatial aggregation patterns of top predators, and contributed to increased rates of whale entanglements in fixed fishing gear.\nHCI is derived from the CCE configuration of the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) model with data assimilation (Neveu et al. 2016), and is estimated in four biogeographic provinces within the CCE: 30°-35.5°N, 35.5°-40°N, 40°-43.5°N, and 43.5°-48°N. HCI is defined as the area of monthly averaged ROMS model temperatures at a depth of 2 m that fall below a temperature threshold. Each region/month has a unique temperature threshold, based on its distinct historic climatology. Seasonal means for central California are shown in the main body of the report (Fig. 2.5).",

    "text": "Snow-water equivalent (SWE) is measured using data from the California Department of Water Resources snow survey program (California Data Exchange Center, cdec.water.ca.gov) and The Natural Resources Conservation Service’s SNOTEL sites across Washington, Oregon, California and Idaho. Snow data are converted into SWEs based on the weight of samples collected at regular intervals using a standardized protocol. Measurements on April 1 are considered the best indicator of maximum extent of SWE; thereafter snow tends to melt rather than accumulate.",

    "text": "Mean maximum stream temperatures in August (Fig. G.2) were determined from 446 USGS gauges with temperature monitoring capability. While these gauges did not necessarily operate simultaneously throughout the period of record, at least two gauges provided data each year in all ecoregions. Stream temperature records are limited in California, so two ecoregions (Sacramento/San Joaquin and Southern California Bight-Baja) were combined. Maximum temperatures exhibit strong ecoregional differences in absolute temperature (for example, Salish Sea and Washington Coast streams are much cooler on average than California streams).",
